We could not determine an easy method for determining the name of
the file that should be saved. As a result the filename is hard
coded as "foo" and awget will always save the file under that name.

the default port for ss is:
  24516

if the -p option is not provided to ss then it will use the
defualt port.

for the chaingang.txt input file, there are some restrictions:
  1. there can't be any trailing whitespace between the host name
     and the ','
  2. there must be at least one space directly before the port
  3. the newline must come directly after the port.
  4. the '<' and '>' are not included in the input file.

example of legal file:
3
onion.cs.colostate.edu, 24516
pepper.cs.colostate.edu, 24516
onion.cs.colostate.edu, 18468
